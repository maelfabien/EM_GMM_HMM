After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed in women. Breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Currently, there is many techniques to diagnose the disease, such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT); this dataset is based on breast tissue samples undergoing EIT. 

The idea is to apply an AC current to each sample (tissue) and then measure nine features during this 'excitation' process. For visualization purposes we need to downgrade the nine-features dataset into a 2D space; we perform PCA as dimensionality reduction technique. The new reduced dataset (2D) is used to fit a GMM model as you can see in the next plot:
