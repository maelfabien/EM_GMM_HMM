GMMs are also used for background subtraction in computer vision for example, where the background is a given cluster, and the objects to keep are another cluster. Rather than focusing on the values of the pixels, such methods rely on the distribution of the value of the pixels in time, thus being able to estimate if the pixels has large changes in values, and estimating whether it is part of the background or not. It is a classical method used in computer vision, but has some troubles handling waving trees, rivers and other dynamic components of a background. Nowadays, Deep Learning methods outperform GMMs.
