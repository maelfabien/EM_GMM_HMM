This website contains an introduction to Expectation Maximization (EM) technique for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We present the theory behind those techniques in the Slides section, and provide interactive examples in the different sections of the application. This website was realised by Juan Pablo Zuluaga and [MaÃ«l Fabien](https://maelfabien.github.io/) as part of the course ["Statistical Sequence Processing"](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/statistical-sequence-processing-EE-605) from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/). 

The technologies used to build this we used Python implementations of GMMs and HMMs, Plotly and Dash for visualization purposes and Heroku for deployment. In this application, you will find information related to:
- Slides and theory of Expectation Maximization for GMMs and HMMs
- Gaussian Mixture Models and its applications
- Expectation Maximization for GMMs
- Expectation Maximization for Hidden Markov Models 
- Applications of HMMs

Please, feel free to reach out to us by [email](mailito:mael.fabien@idiap.ch) if you have any remark or question. The code of the application can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/maelfabien/EM_GMM_HMM), feel free to contribute!
